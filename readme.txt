Installation Instructions
===========================
The only module required to run bach.py is Music21 which can be 
found here https://code.google.com/p/music21/downloads/list and
instructions for installation here http://mit.edu/music21/doc/html/install.html#install

If you wish to use the show() method for streams to display the
sheet music for generated harmonies or melodies, you will need to
install a program for editing or viewing musical notation and edit the 
music21 configuration settings to use that view as the default. 
We recommend MuseScore which can be found at http://www.musescore.org
More information about editing settings can be found here
http://mit.edu/music21/doc/html/environment.html#environment

If you're interested in other software that can be used to extend the
functionality of Music21 you can find more information at

Instructions for Use
======================
The gen_model function generates the overarching model that provides the
basis for the gen_melody and gen_harmony functions. The choice of the
order for the chord, melody, and offsets will uniquely determine the model.
Before parsing the library of Bach's music, this function determines if the
specified model has been computed before and, if so, reloads it. Because this
function takes a relatively long time to run, the results of the computation
are saved after each run with a new combination of parameters. Note high 
parameter values for the chord model may lead to difficulty in generating
harmony.

The gen_melody function returns a melody based on a given model. The length parameter
specifies the number of individual notes in a melody. Each run of gen_melody generates
a new melody generated from the model.

The gen_harmony function returns a four part harmony from a given melody and model.
Given a melody it is possible that gen_harmony is unable to realize a valid harmony
to fit the melody. If that is the case, generate a new melody and try gen_harmony again

For both the melodies and harmonies generated by gen_melody and gen_harmony, the show('midi')
method can be used to create a midi file of the generated music. If a music reader has
been installed an configured show() or show('musicxml') can be used to open the sheet
music in your defaut reader. Without the reader installed, show('musicxml') will create
a musicxml file in a temporary folder.
